# ChatDKG Developer Tooling

Polyflow team will use our internally developed tooling to bring Knowledge Graph support & ChatDKG support to millions of Web2 developers, hiding all complexities of interacting with blockchain.

## The Challenge

* dkg-client is a JS SDK which enables developers to integrate Knowledge Graphs into their apps. 
* It abstracts away the process of creating an NFT & publishing a new version of the Knowledge Graph.
* However, dkg-client still requires the developer to have some Web3 specific knowledge or the user to have a Web3 wallet installed. This greatly limits developer & user accessibility.

## The Solution

Integrate Polyflow SDK & Transaction Processing Backend as an extension SDK to the dkg-client SDK!

Benefits
* Developers donâ€™t need to know anything about blockchain development to integrate dkg-client!
* Users can be logged in via email or phone number, instead of wallet address!
* Out-of-the box analytics for all transactions & graph updates/queries!
* Transactions are processed automatically by a backend process.

## The Impact

### AI Developers

* Develop extensions & plugins for AI developer tools with Knowledge Graph.
* Enable AI backends to write updates into the Knowledge Graph through a simple HTTP call.
* Hide the complexity of blockchain & transaction signing.

### Web2 Developers

* Develop plugins for frontend frameworks, which feed data automatically into the Knowledge Graph (e.g. Wordpress, Shopify, Angular, React).
* Enable frontend actions to update the Knowledge Graph with a simple HTTP call.

### Users

* Log-in to tools which interact with Knowledge Graph with their email or phone. 
* Get subsidized gas & token costs or pay them with a simple credit card tx.
* Hide the blockchain from users.
