# ChatDKG Developer Tooling

Polyflow team will use our internally developed tooling to bring Knowledge Graph support & ChatDKG support to millions of Web2 developers, hiding all complexities of interacting with blockchain.

## The Challenge

* dkg-client is a JS SDK which enables developers to integrate Knowledge Graphs into their apps. 
* It abstracts away the process of creating an NFT & publishing a new version of the Knowledge Graph.
* However, dkg-client still requires the developer to have some Web3 specific knowledge or the user to have a Web3 wallet installed. This greatly limits developer & user accessibility.

## The Solution

Integrate Polyflow SDK & Transaction Processing Backend as an extension SDK to the dkg-client SDK!

Benefits
* Developers donâ€™t need to know anything about blockchain development to integrate dkg-client!
* Users can be logged in via email or phone number, instead of wallet address!
* Out-of-the box analytics for all transactions & graph updates/queries!
* Transactions are processed automatically by a backend process.

## The Impact

### AI Developers

* Develop extensions & plugins for AI developer tools with Knowledge Graph.
* Enable AI backends to write updates into the Knowledge Graph through a simple HTTP call.
* Hide the complexity of blockchain & transaction signing.

### Web2 Developers

* Develop plugins for frontend frameworks, which feed data automatically into the Knowledge Graph (e.g. Wordpress, Shopify, Angular, React).
* Enable frontend actions to update the Knowledge Graph with a simple HTTP call.

### Users

* Log-in to tools which interact with Knowledge Graph with their email or phone. 
* Get subsidized gas & token costs or pay them with a simple credit card tx.
* Hide the blockchain from users.

## Milestones

### Milestone #1 | SDK Wrapper around dkg-client functions

Time: 30 days

Description: We will build a wrapper around dkg-client which exposes all the functionality of the dkg-client SDK, but doesn't require the developer to add transaction signing and provides custodial wallet support, gasless transactions, full transaction-oriented analytics & human readable transaction previews.

### Milestone #2 | HTTP-based backed signer & TX manager

Time: 30 days

Description: We will build an HTTP-based signer, which enable teams to automate the interaction with Knowledge Graphs through any HTTP-enabled device, including mobile apps, bakend apps, IoT/Hardware devices, etc... 

# Case / Example

In this example, we will demonstrate the abilities of the Polyflow Code SDK wrapper & infra on an example from the 3rd ChatDKG Office Hours. We will explore the case of adding the pamphlet information for the imaginary drug `yewmakerol` to the Knowledge Graph - but this time, from a perspective of an AI engineer (or any other Web2 developer) who is not familiar with anything blockchain related.

The example is very simple:

1. The developer will create a new Polyflow Code project - and get an API Key
2. The developer will use `npm` to install the `polyflow` SDK and the `origintrail` extension.
3. The developer calls the exposed methods.

```js
import Polyflow from '@polyflow/core'
import DKG from '@polyflow/origintrail'

const sdk = new Polyflow('api-key')

// The DKG SDK is now created as a wrapper around the Polyflow SDK. The developer uses the Polyflow
// dashboard to set up RPC endpoints, DKG enpoints and selects the signer.
//
// The signer can be a frontend widget signer *or* a backend signer. The frotnend signer is great for native
// Web3 apps, while the backend signer is great for backend apps, bot automation & frontend apps which want to use
// the 
const dkg = new Polyflow.DKG(sdk)

const yewmakerol = JSON.parse('./path/to/yewmakerol.json')

dkg.asset.create(yewmakerol, { epochsNum: 5 }).then(result => {
  // this callback is called after the asset has been signed, added to the DKG and updated on the blockchain
  console.log(result)
})

```
